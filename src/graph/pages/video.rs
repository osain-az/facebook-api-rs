//! The Facebook Video API allows you to publish Videos on Pages and Groups.
//! Publishing on Users is not supported.
//!
//! The process for publishing Videos involves choosing an upload protocol and
//! sending a POST request to the targeted Page or Group's  to end point /videos
//! edge. The API  supports  postting video by video_url, Resumable and
//! Non-Resumableupload protocols.
//! Facebook recommend that you use the Resumable Upload protocol
//! as it is more  versatile and can gracefully handle connection interruptions.
//! To post to either page or group pass either of the id.  (/event-id/videos,
//! /page-id/videos /group-id/videos
//!
//! For other information check on facebook documentation  for
//! video API  <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/video-api/guides/publishing>
//! For information on different opertaions on facebook page  check  <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/videos/#Creating>
